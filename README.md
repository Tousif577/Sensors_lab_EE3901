This repository documents my learning journey into the basics of sensors, their practical applications, and the programming aspects required to work with them. The focus is not only on theoretical understanding but also on hands-on experiments that connect electronics, signal processing, and software.
In this project, we performed four experiments that cover different types of sensors, circuit design, and data analysis techniques:

ðŸ”¬ Experiments

1.Instrumentation Amplifier Design

Built an instrumentation amplifier from scratch using op-amps.
Learned about differential measurement, gain setting, and noise reduction for sensor signals.

2.NTC Thermistor Temperature Sensor

Designed a temperature sensing circuit using an NTC thermistor.
Wrote programs to process the sensor output and calculate practical temperature values.

3.Compass with Hall Effect Sensors

Implemented a compass using Hall effect sensors.
Applied concepts of electromagnetics to detect magnetic field direction and determine orientation.

4.Accelerometer-Based Step Detection (MATLAB)

Collected accelerometer data from a mobile phone.
Applied MATLAB filtering techniques to clean the signal.
Developed algorithms to detect steps, classify them as walking, steps up, or steps down, and count total steps.
